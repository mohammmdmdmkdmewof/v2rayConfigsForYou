# Myv2rayConfigs
 this repository searches for various v2ray configs in chats the account is a member of and updates every 1 hour and saves output to a txt file . 
 + i was using this for myself as a personal project but i thought making it public would help some people connect to unrestricted internet.
 + the telegram.session.aes256 is just the encypted session file for github actions so it updates automatically you can edit the code to use your telegram account.
